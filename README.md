# Giftify

## Description

Giftify is a user friendly application that was created to organize and simplify holiday shopping.  When a user logs in, this app allows a user to create an organized table of loved ones that lists name, gift ideas, budget, gifting status, and the capability to remove the recipient. Through the use of open AI, when a recipient is created given the information of gender and age, giftting suggestions are created and able to be added to that recipient's row.
